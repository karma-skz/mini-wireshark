# The Terminal Packet Sniffer  

> 🦈 **Welcome to the C-Shark Division!**  
> This is **LAZY Corp’s** idea of a cybersecurity team. Forget expensive firewalls or fancy monitoring tools — you’ll be handed a **terminal-based shark fin** and told to sniff out suspicious packets.  
Your task is to build C-Shark, a terminal-only sniffer that LAZY Corp swears is “just as good as Wireshark” (legal says we have to stop calling it “diet Wireshark”). With it, you’ll see everything flowing through the network: shady MAC addresses, questionable IP headers, and DNS queries that definitely don’t look work-related.  
Think of it as giving you x-ray specs for the internet, only instead of superheroes, you’re an underpaid intern staring at hex dumps.

## Your Arsenal & The Rules of Engagement

Before we begin our expedition into the network stream, let's go over your toolkit and some ground
rules.

**Your Primary Weapon: libpcap** 
The core of our sniffer will be built using the pcap library.
You'll need to include pcap.h. You are also encouraged to use the standard C networking
libraries to decode the packet headers.

```c
#include <pcap.h>
#include <net/ethernet.h>
#include <netinet/ip.h>
#include <netinet/ip6.h>
#include <netinet/tcp.h>
#include <netinet/udp.h>
#include <netinet/ip_icmp.h>
#include <net/if_arp.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>
```

**Creative Freedom:** The example input/output formats shown below are just that—examples!
You have the freedom to design your own interface, as long as all the required functionality is
present and the output is clear and readable.

**Reconnaissance is Key:** It is highly recommended to read through all the project phases
before writing a single line of code. A good plan will help you structure your code in a modular
and expandable way from the very beginning.

**Choosing Your Hunting Ground:** College Wi-Fi or corporate LANs can have complex
configurations (it will and should still work on it, but the packets on there may be less predictable). 
For easier debugging, it's a great idea to use your own personal hotspot. The
packets will be much more predictable! Even if you don't have hotspot connection, you can set up and
try to debug using localhost (`lo` interface - a localserver) for testing purposes.

**Root Privileges Required:** Packet sniffing requires deep access to the network stack. You
will need to run your final executable with sudo for it to work.

```bash
sudo ./cshark
```

**A Shark, Not a Kraken:** Remember your role. You are a silent predator, observing from the depths.
Your job is to watch the traffic flow by, not to thrash about and create a tidal wave. C-Shark is a *listener*, not a talker. 
You are strictly forbidden from sending, injecting, or crafting packets. LAZY Corp’s legal team has a very small budget,
and they don’t want to spend it bailing you out for taking down the campus Wi-Fi. Observe only.

And when the big day comes, **keep [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) handy** – it's your official 'reality check' to ensure your sniffer isn't just making things up. That is have wireshark downloaded and setup on your system during the evals.

## Phase 1: Setting the Hook - Interface & Basic Capture

Our first step is to set up the sniffer, find the right place to listen, and start catching our first packets.

### Task 1.1: Device Discovery [3]

As soon as your program launches, it must scan for all available network interfaces on the machine
and present them to the user in a numbered list. The user should be able to select an interface to
monitor.

**Example Output:**
```
[C-Shark] The Command-Line Packet Predator
==============================================
[C-Shark] Searching for available interfaces... Found!

1. wlan0
2. any (Pseudo-device that captures on all interfaces)
3. lo
4. docker0
5. bluetooth0 (Bluetooth adapter number 0)
6. bluetooth-monitor (Bluetooth Linux Monitor)
7. nflog (Linux netfilter log (NFLOG) interface)
8. nfqueue (Linux netfilter queue (NFQUEUE) interface)
9. dbus-system (D-Bus system bus)
10. dbus-session (D-Bus session bus)

Select an interface to sniff (1-10):
```

### Task 1.2: The Main Menu & First Catch [2]

After the user selects an interface, they should be presented with the main menu. For this phase, you
only need to implement the first option.

**Main Menu:**
```
[C-Shark] Interface 'wlan0' selected. What's next?

1. Start Sniffing (All Packets)
2. Start Sniffing (With Filters) <-- To be implemented later
3. Inspect Last Session <-- To be implemented later
4. Exit C-Shark
```

**Sniffing All Packets:** When the user selects this, the program will start capturing and
displaying a live feed of all packets on the chosen interface. For each packet, display:

- A unique Packet ID (e.g., starting from 1).
- The packet's timestamp.
- The captured length of the packet in bytes.
- The first 16 raw bytes of the packet frame in hexadecimal format.

**Graceful Controls:**
- **Ctrl+C**: This should not terminate the program. Instead, it should stop the live
capture and return the user to the main menu.
- **Ctrl+D**: This should be the universal "get me out of here" command, exiting the
application cleanly from any point.

## Phase 2: The Deep Dive - Layer-by-Layer Dissection [15]

Now that we can catch packets, it's time to learn what's inside them. In this phase, we will enhance
our packet display to decode information layer by layer. You can now replace the raw 16-byte hex
dump with this more detailed analysis.

### Task 2.1: The Data Link Dance (Layer 2) [3]

Decode the Ethernet header. For each packet, along with the existing info (ID, timestamp, length),
display:

- Source MAC Address
- Destination MAC Address
- EtherType: Identify if the payload is IPv4, IPv6, ARP, or "unknown" (you need not identify
other types).

**Example Output:**
```
-----------------------------------------
Packet #1113 | Timestamp: 1757370992.553060 | Length: 66 bytes
L2 (Ethernet): Dst MAC: E6:51:4A:2D:B0:F9 | Src MAC: B4:8C:9D:5D:86:A1 |
EtherType: IPv4 (0x0800)
```

### Task 2.2: Navigating the Network Maze (Layer 3) [4]

Based on the EtherType from Layer 2, decode the network layer packet. You must support IPv4, IPv6,
and ARP.

**For IPv4:** Display Source IP, Destination IP, Protocol (TCP, UDP, need to be identified, rest
unknown is fine), TTL, Packet ID, Total Length, Header Length, and any Flags (aptly decoded).

**For IPv6:** Display Source IP, Destination IP, Next Header (identifying TCP/UDP, and can skip
the rest), Hop Limit, Traffic Class, Flow Label, and Payload Length.

**For ARP:** Display Operation (not just the number, the apt decoding), Sender & Target IP and
MAC addresses, and other relevant fields like Hardware Type/Length and Protocol Type/Length
(need not be decoded).

**Example Outputs:**
```
-----------------------------------------

Next Header: TCP (6) | Hop Limit: 64 | Traffic Class: 0 | Flow
Label: 0x00000 | Payload Length: 548
```

### Task 2.3: Unpacking the Cargo (Layer 4) [4]

Based on the protocol from Layer 3, decode the transport layer segment. You must support TCP and
UDP.

**For TCP:** Display Source & Destination Ports (and identify common ones like http, https, dns,
in particular), Sequence Number, Acknowledgement Number, Flags (decoded, e.g., [SYN,
ACK]), Window Size, Checksum, and Header Length.

**For UDP:** Display Source & Destination Ports (same as TCP), Length, and Checksum.

**Example Outputs:**
```
-----------------------------------------
Packet #1139 | Timestamp: 1757370992.785491 | Length: 136 bytes
L2 (Ethernet): Dst MAC: B4:8C:9D:5D:86:A1 | Src MAC: E6:51:4A:2D:B0:F9 |

L4 (TCP): Src Port: 35554 | Dst Port: 443 (HTTPS) | Seq: 4016914192 | Ack: 0
| Flags: [SYN]
Window: 64800 | Checksum: 0x804D | Header Length: 40 bytes
```

### Task 2.4: Inspecting the Contents (Layer 7 / Payload) [4]

Finally, let's peek at the actual data.

**Identify Application Protocol:** Based on the port numbers, identify common protocols like
HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS. For others, you can label them "Unknown".

**Display Payload:** Show the length of the payload. And, you must display the first 64 bytes of
the payload in a combined hex and ASCII format (a "hex dump" - this format is mandatory).

**Example Outputs:**
```
-----------------------------------------
Packet #1130 | Timestamp: 1757370992.568192 | Length: 179 bytes

## Phase 3: Precision Hunting - Filtering the Stream [2]

Implement the second option in the main menu: Start Sniffing (With Filters). When the user
selects this, they should be able to apply a filter to see only the packets they care about. You must
support filtering by the following protocols:

- HTTP
- HTTPS
- DNS
- ARP
- TCP
- UDP

## Phase 4: The Packet Aquarium - Saving Your Catch [2]

A good detective keeps records. Your application must store the packets captured during the most
recent sniffing session (whether filtered or not).

**Storage:** You are free to decide how to store them(presistance not mandatory).

**Capacity:** Define a macro for the maximum number of packets to store (e.g., #define
MAX_PACKETS 10000).

**Memory Management:** C-Shark must only store packets from the last session. When a new
sniffing session starts, you must free any memory allocated for the previous session to prevent
memory leaks(if any). If the user tries to inspect a session when none has been run yet,
display an appropriate error message.

## Phase 5: The Digital Forensics Lab - In-Depth Inspection [6]

It's time to put a single packet under the microscope. Implement the third option in the main menu:
Inspect Last Session.

**Selection:** The program should list the summary of all stored packets from the last session
(ID, timestamp, length, basic L3/L4 info). The user can then enter a Packet ID to inspect it
more closely.

**In-Depth Analysis:** The output for the selected packet must be a comprehensive breakdown.
For every supported layer, you must show both the raw hexadecimal values and their
human-readable interpretation. The entire packet frame must also be displayed in a full
hex dump (a "hex dump" must be present). And even the payload if applicable. Here's an example of how the output might [look](https://postimg.cc/gallery/VfHVg5L) (just an example,
you can design your own format, what to put, what not to put as long as the basic minimum requirements are met
...the example has a couple of extra and missing things).

## Submission Format

Your project should be submitted with a Makefile. Running make should compile your source code
and produce an executable. The program should be runnable via:

```bash
make
sudo ./cshark
```

# My own summary-
Project: C-Shark (concise implementation summary)

This project is a simple, terminal-based packet sniffer implemented in C using libpcap. The code captures packets at the link layer and performs multi-layer decoding (Ethernet → IP → TCP/UDP/ICMP), prints human-friendly summaries, and optionally shows hex dumps of packet payloads.

Key implementation details
- Capture: Uses libpcap to open an interface (or `any`) and run a live capture loop. Ctrl+C gracefully stops the capture and returns to the interactive menu.
- Filtering: Applies user-supplied BPF filters (for example: `tcp port 80`). Note: this implementation treats HTTP by filtering on port numbers (e.g. `tcp port 80`) rather than a protocol-level `http` dissector — so you will see all traffic on that port, including TCP handshakes and ACKs, not only HTTP payload packets.
- Decoding: Layers are decoded and displayed with readable fields:
	- Layer 2: Ethernet addresses and EtherType
	- Layer 3: IPv4/IPv6 headers (addresses, TTL, flags)
	- Layer 4: TCP/UDP/ICMP headers (ports, sequence/ack, flags)
	- HTTP: Basic payload detection and simple decoding when TCP payload looks like HTTP
- Sessions & Inspection: Captured packets are stored in an in-memory session. The interactive inspector shows a session summary table and lets you examine individual packets with detailed layer-by-layer analysis and hex dumps.

Files of interest
- `src/main.c`      — program entry, argument parsing, interactive menu
- `src/capture.c`   — libpcap setup, capture loop, layer decoding callbacks
- `src/inspect.c`   — session inspection, packet summary and detailed analysis
- `src/filter.c`    — interactive/filter helpers (BPF menus)
- `src/session.c`   — stores captured packets for post-capture inspection

Usage notes
- Build with: `make` (requires libpcap development headers and root privileges for live capture)
- Run with sudo for capturing: `sudo ./cshark` or use flags like `-i <iface>` and `-f "tcp port 80"` for non-interactive capture
- Hexdump: Enable with `-x` to print packet payloads in hex

Why the port-based HTTP filtering mention matters
Using `tcp port 80` captures every packet whose TCP endpoint is port 80 — that includes the HTTP payloads but also the TCP handshake (SYN/ACK) and pure ACKs. Wireshark's `http` display filter is a higher-level check that shows only packets it recognizes as containing HTTP messages. We intentionally show the lower-level port-based view to expose the full conversation on that port (same applies to port 443 / HTTPS).
